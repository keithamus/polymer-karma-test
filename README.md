polymer-karma-test
==================

This repo is designed as a simple boilerplate for having multiple polymer elements and Karma test runner.


### Install
`npm i`

### Run
`npm t`

## Known Issues

Karma fails currently, it seems as though Polymer loads the dependencies without any kind of resolution - so the "a-element" is getting loaded twice. See the logs:
